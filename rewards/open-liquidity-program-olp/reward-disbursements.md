description: How OLP Rewards Are Disbursed

# Reward Disbursements

OLP Rewards are sent directly to the participants' addresses after the end of each epoch. **Half of the earned INJ rewards are paid out immediately, while the other half is subject to a 3 epoch vesting period**. If the address is inactive (earns rewards < 1 INJ) for any epoch during the vesting period, the vested rewards will be subject to forfeiture. All rewards are subject to governance approval.

{% hint style="info" %}
Disbursements usually occur a few days after the conclusion of each epoch due to the governance process required.
{% endhint %}

Reward disbursements can be tracked on the Community Spend Pool page on the [Injective Explorer](https://explorer.injective.network/).
