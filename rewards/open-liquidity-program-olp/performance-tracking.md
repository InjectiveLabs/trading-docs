# Performance Tracking

Current and historical information on market allocations, expected/earned rewards, scores per market, and eligibility can be found on the [OLP Dashboard](https://trading.injective.network/program/liquidity) in the [Injective Trading Portal](https://trading.injective.network/).&#x20;

Snapshot data can be found under the [Scores tab](https://trading.injective.network/program/liquidity/scores). CSV files can also be downloaded in the [Scores tab](https://trading.injective.network/program/liquidity/scores) to view scores for all addresses and all markets at the same timeâ€”this information may be helpful for market participants that wish to view data on a broad level.

OLP data for current and previous epochs can also be queried programmatically:&#x20;
